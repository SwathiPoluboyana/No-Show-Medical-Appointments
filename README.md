# No-Show-Medical-Appointments
A person makes an doctor appoinment but doesnt show up! Why? What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?

This dataset has information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.There are 14 variables in the dataset and 'No-Show' column says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.
